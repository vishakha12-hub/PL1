What a great name you have, Tejas!

Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.

Your age is 52; that's a good time to start programming!

Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 5
0!
1!
2!
3!
4!
5!

Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.
> 3
Please, try again.
> 2

Congratulations, have a nice day!
